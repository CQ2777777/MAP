DQN2.py: Contains the neural network architecture for the DQN agent.

SAVE_state.py: Handles the initialization of POD (possibly "Phase Observation Data") for the first 3000 seconds of simulation.

*.pth files: Pre-trained model weights for the DQN agent.

loop_1_MAIN_revised.py: Main control loop for 1x1 intersection scenario (uses test.sumocfg).

loop_1_MAIN_revised_2x2.py: Main control loop for 2x2 intersection scenario (uses loop2x2.sumocfg).
